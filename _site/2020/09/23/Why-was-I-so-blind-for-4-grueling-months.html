    <p>Life purpose: I have thought long and hard about why I was so blind. Why couldn’t I understand my coach’s words, time and time again? Why couldn’t I see the importance of viewing the scenes from my character’s deathbed? Why, instead, was I so focused on scene level consequences rather than life purpose consequences?</p>

<p>The biggest reason was a misfocused frame of mind. Wanting to find <em>external</em> consequences, I misinterpreted what external meant. In writing, I’ve been taught, external typically means something you can see or take a photo of. So I imagined things ~I~ could see happening. Such as my character, after having a frightful experience at yoga, quits attending the classes and starts working late hours. And externally I stopped there since it felt like a strong consequence. One that ~I~ could see that.</p>

<p>But I’ve realized it doesn’t matter what ~I~ can see, it matters what my character sees.</p>

<p>The definition of what is external completely changes when imagined from his deathbed. From there would my character see that yoga scene? Would this scene <em>matter</em>? Let’s say his life purpose was to feed the hungry; would this scene matter? No. To Josh reflecting on his life — <em>this scene wouldn’t be seen, it wouldn’t matter. This scene wouldn’t be matter.</em></p>

<p>It wouldn’t exist from Josh’s frame of mind. I had focused so much on what I could see, when in the reality of my story, all that matters or all that is matter is what my character can see.</p>

<p>And this must be the journey of a writer: movement away from the self, deeper into my character’s skin, crawling layer by layer underneath his skin until you find his soul.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> * * * </p>

<p>And, I see here, there are two steps for it: (1) asking the right questions. (2) asking the questions with the right frame of mind. Professional writers do both of those. The beauty: it can be trained. With enough play and thought, you can train yourself to ask the right questions with the right lenses in mind.</p>
