  &lt;p&gt;The third filter, the third layer, is pseudoreasoning, rationalization, explanations, excuses. All are borrowed. Not a single one is your own authentic experience, but they give a kind of satisfaction: you think you are a very rational being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can vary from the basic poison of making an excuse not to do something you want to do, such as not calling a friend who you miss because they haven’t called you recently, or the more complex poison where you rationalize away situations and events in order to feel better, instead of exploring what the feeling is telling you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s easy to find comfort in rationalizations. They calm my mind, it seems. Most of my journey has been spent observing myself, explaining my behavior, and trying to understand and rationalize my thoughts. How much harm has this secretly done? What cost is there to rationalizations, no matter how savory, such as one of my favorites: this too shall pass? What deeper seeded feelings and personalities and thoughts am I suppressing with this borrowed language? What if instead of trying to understand and explain – I felt what needed to be felt or I expressed whatever needed to be expressed and let out, whatever personality arose, fearful, hateful, depressed, even psychopathic laughing, screeching. Get it out. It wants me to take action, to say something, to change something, to do something. I, however, breathe and whisper this too shall pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is why these absolute truths and reminders are never effective when you’re helping a friend through a difficult time. Although you can remind them, I know you know this, but this too shall pass – in their emotional, pain-ridden state, that has nothing to do with who they are. Your rationalizations don’t help. They just want to be felt and understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if instead, we remind them about authentic truths. We talk about their real journey, what they have gone through, how much they’ve learned and grown, how valuable they are. We talked about how they now feel sadness and grief at the loss of a beautiful thing. Something they had the opportunity to experience and to play with and to love. Something that if they made many sacrifices for, and they took many chances for, and if they didn’t change they would have never had to opportunity to be with that beauty. But they tried. They cared. Just something pushed them in a different direction. And all those opportunities to play with that beauty helped them change and see the world with new colors. And now they are here. About to embark on a new journey. Filled with new beautiful things. And even more colors. Just waiting to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can go on making excuses, rationalizations, and explanations. It’s your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Man goes on burdening himself because he cannot cry and cannot weep, it is “unmanly.” And women have been taught to cry and weep, it is perfectly womanly, so they go on crying and weeping even where it is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is often the starting point of stories. In my coach’s system, I first identify the misbelief that has been culturally or parentally or eventually trained. And with that starting location in mind, I explore how my character lives out his life with that misbelief, watching how that belief evolves picking up new harmful beliefs, escalates becoming more harmful and damning, and expands rippling into other layers in his life, until soon the belief corrupts everything he does. And he’s in a dark place, unable to see a way out, a way back to his true self. And then, page 1 of our story begins, as he tries to return home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories teach us to get more in touch with our intuition by exposing these misbeliefs and these corrupted layers that block us. The next blockage is a fault of my own: &lt;a href=&quot;(https://silencevosh.github.io/2020/11/04/intuition-corrupted-by-rationalization.html)&quot;&gt;rationalization.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Silence</name></author><category term="humanlearnings" /><summary type="html">Man goes on burdening himself because he cannot cry and cannot weep, it is “unmanly.” And women have been taught to cry and weep, it is perfectly womanly, so they go on crying and weeping even where it is not needed.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">intuition | corrupted by the senses</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/11/02/intuition-corrupted-by-the-senses.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="intuition | corrupted by the senses" /><published>2020-11-02T06:10:59-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-02T06:10:59-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/11/02/intuition-corrupted-by-the-senses</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/11/02/intuition-corrupted-by-the-senses.html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your physical senses have been trained. You see things if your society allows you to see them, you hear things if your society allows you to hear them. You touch things if your society allows you to touch them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A child sees a crystal glass on a ledge and reaches for it. His dad quickly slaps his hand away; it’s his father’s glass and is not for children. The child now knows crystal glasses are not to be touched. No matter how badly his physical body wants to explore the colors splitting through it, he must not touch the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or what natural part of our body grosses us out, or we’re uncomfortable with and wouldn’t want others to see. That we pick our nose when it’s irritating? That our shit doesn’t smell like roses? That sometimes we touch ourselves because it feels so good? As children, how many times were we yelled at for touching ourselves or picking our nose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these experiences corrupt our senses from experiencing the outer world like we truly want to.&lt;/p&gt;

When you study his work on intuition, you can start to understand his intentions and understand how he got to a place where he was misbehaving sexually and spending money without real purpose. His goal I believe was to strip away any and all cultural rules, and follow whatever desire is at the center. He wrote a book on intuition that delves into these cultural layers, and which he pinpoints as the corruption of intuition. Let’s examine those to get a look at how we can be more in touch with our true desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what does he mean when he talks about intuition? He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Intuition is a totally different kind of phenomenon from reason. Reason argues; reason uses a process to reach a conclusion. Intuition jumps—it is a quantum leap. It knows no process. It simply reaches to the conclusion without any process. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many mathematicians have been able to do any kind of mathematical problem without going into its process. Their functioning was intuitive. You just say the problem, and before you have even said it, the conclusion will come. There has not been a time gap at all. You were saying it and the moment you finished, or even before you finished, the conclusion has come. Mathematicians have always been puzzled by these freak phenomena. These people—how do they do it? If a mathematician was to do this problem, it might take three hours or two hours or one hour. Even a computer will take at least a few minutes to do it, but these people don’t take a single moment. You say it, and instantly … So in mathematics, intuition is now a recognized fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s a force that can make leaps without thought interfearing. If you are getting ready to go to dinner with your wife and she asks where do you want to eat? Your intuitive answer makes the leap to your real desire, let’s say Mexican food, without rationally knowing why. You don’t have to weigh the pros and cons, and you don’t have to reason a decision. You just know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corrupted intuition, then, would be a blockage to that force. Osho laid these blockages; there are five of them that I will go through one at a time, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://silencevosh.github.io/2020/11/02/intuition-corrupted-by-the-senses.html&quot;&gt;physical blockages.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Silence</name></author><category term="humanlearnings" /><summary type="html">Back in intuition: What are the extremes I talked about how Osho was the pinnacle of someone following his desires —- and solely his desires.

&lt;p&gt;Two ways this happens: Secrets and Lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets and lies create false realities. Lying is the obvious form of betrayal. But even keeping secrets can create betrayal. For example, in my story, Josh who’s in a struggling relationship, asks his girlfriend, Em, to come on an adventure with him. He advertises the adventure by saying, “Hey, Em, look, this trip, this spark of excitement, could be what we need to save our relationship.” His secret, however, is he needs Em to travel with him because in order to enter the community that he wants to visit, he’s required to have a female partner. So in reality, he couldn’t go without Em. So under this pretense, they will travel together and spend months there, until eventually, Em finds out his intentions weren’t to save the relationship but for his work. Spooked, she learns she’s been living a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exploring secrets and lies, we can discover where realities begin to diverge and can push that even more until we break one of our characters, spook them so much that they are unable to recover. Because it’s only from that space that we learn to change.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduced as the new office secretary, quickly she fell into the trap of a New York office building in the 60s and was seduced by one of the male workers. She had his child in private, meanwhile, continue to show up and work every day. Working hard, she wanted to be more than a secretary, and eventually earned her place at the creative table, surrounded by all advertising men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning season 3, she’s different from the rest of the office floor. She can’t fit in with the men, no matter what she does, and now she’s the only woman with an office of her own. Throughout the first couple of episodes, we notice her watching the other women and how they sweet-talk visiting clients. Afterwards, she goes home and acts pretty in the mirroring, singing a Marilyn Monroe “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” type performance. Later, she’s in a bar, surrounded by women who seem to naturally attract the eyes of a man. She awkwardly gets a man to buy her a drink, and while conversing with him, she feels his immaturity. She feels different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knows this difference, and although she’s proud of it, wants to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my prediction this season: we will watch her first succumb to this desire to be one of the girls, to regress into the role of a ditzy secretary, then by the end, after making many mistakes, maybe getting pregnant a second time, she’ll overcome it and embody that she’s different and that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Silence</name></author><category term="storyblink" /><summary type="html">In just two seasons, Peggy has been on a rollercoaster.

How does this other person fit within our motivations. Yes, it’s a selfish, self-centered way of looking at it. That’s the way of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it’s not, oh you’re sexy, I’m motivated to sleep with you so I will. And sadly, it’s not, oh hey Stephan King, I’m a big fan and am motivated to be your mentee, so let’s begin the lessons. Rather it’s a mutual meshing of motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my current work, my character, Josh, just met the soon to be the love of his life, Em. On the first date, where did their motivations mesh? Travel. Em has wanted to travel outside the country for years, but has always been too scared to take the leap. Josh speaks five languages, yet hasn’t stepped foot out of Illinois. Em starts telling herself a story: just think of all the countries we could fluently travel through. Josh, too, imagines experiencing the world, driven by love. So they meet for a 2nd date. And a 3rd. 4th, 5th…soon little Joshs and Ems are born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This often happens in unhealthy ways. For example, be it sexual or just a friend, let’s say one partner gives too much because fulfilling someone’s else’s desires fulfills their own. While the other leaches on givers and takes and takes and takes. Even though these two have motivations that mesh, it’s an unhealthy relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, it’s an illuminating experiment to examine your relationships, examining the motivations on both sides. What ones are healthy? What ones are one-sided? Where can you give more? How can you cherish your shared motivation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the show’s prequel, Breaking Bad, Mike is a pro’s pro assassin. Better Call Saul starts from the beginning, and we watch his evolution from a freshly retired police office into that man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the show, Mike is central to two types of scenes. (1) he gets a job where he must outwit another in order to get it done, and the violent nature of these jobs escalate, getting him deeper and deeper into the game. Or (2) he plays with his granddaughter and we see his softer side, we see the reason he’s doing it all, making the money to support her, since her father, (his son), has died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s those promises repeated over and over that we grow to expect when Mike’s face on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently one moment didn’t fit that pattern, a super refreshing moment. During his daily diner visit, he has like three lines of banter with the waitress, and a slight smile afterwards. It’s this tiny interaction that breaks that pattern of doing a job, seeing the granddaughter, doing a job, seeing his granddaughter. Suddenly — once broken — he because more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Because of the layers my coach always talks about, I believe. Humans are complex characters with hierarchies of agendas and emotions. For the most part, we only see Mike the character’s agenda. When in reality Mike the human has many different agendas. So this little flash of him potentially interested in the waitress gave him another layer of humanity. He does have a voice whispering in his head about women. I can relate to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent manuscript, my coach highlighted when I did this well, when I gave my character extra layers. My character just got put on probation. I was exploring how that event had affected him mentally and emotionally. I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He also has his father’s voice replying in his head. You’re the first in our family to attend	college. Make the most of it. Josh thinks I can’t even tell them that I’m on probation. He	would be knocking at my door in 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s these simple layers that add complexity and force us to get closer to the characters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Silence</name></author><category term="storyblink" /><summary type="html">One character in Better Call Saul is Mike, an no bullshit, and always short with people, old man.

Nothing is deemed meaningful unless it has something else to be compared with. For example, if you came from a planet filled with dinosaurs, an elephant would look small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is important in the early stages of character creation when you’re trying to figure out where is meaning and pain for them, where are triggers. One mistake I made early on was knowing my character Devon was going to see boyish games like GI-Joes as immature, I jumped to that conclusion, without figuring out why. At one point these toys brought joy into his life, so why do they now bring sourness or the feeling of immaturity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if we traveled across the galaxy to our alien’s dinosaur world and then returned to earth, an elephant would seem like a poodle. So what experience gave Devon new meaning into these toys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I realized, oh he had been hanging out with a neighbor girl, Lucy, and most likely something happened around that; perhaps maybe Lucy’s baby brother is annoying them with toys, and Lucy yells at him. And new those figurines take on new meaning. To be close to Lucy means to grow away from those toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when Devon enters the playroom, that new meaning is infused in his actions, and I understand why, I understand what it’s compared to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Silence</name></author><category term="humanlearnings" /><summary type="html">This is a helpful model from my coach.

One of the biggest takeaways that still continually revisits me is indirect communication or speaking A to C as it was called in improv. “A” is the first thing you think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of a response in A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    ”Would you like a brownie,” speaker1 asks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    ”No, thank you though,”speaker2 responds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deeper response B:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    ”No, I’m on a diet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even deeper C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    ”No, I’m trying to fit into my dad-jeans from the 80s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does speaking in C create a deeper connection? Because it gives information in who you are as a person, into your past, into your present, and into your desires, rather than an objective, robotic no. When you make that leap, you share more of who you are and you gain a unique voice, all in roughly the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example from James Scott Bell, in a book on writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you were writing The Godfather […], and Michael Corleone has come to Las Vegas to tell the older, more established Moe Green that the Corleone family is buying out his interest in the casinos. &lt;br /&gt; 
Moe Green is outraged. What does he say in response? At first, you might write it like this: &lt;br /&gt;
   I’m Moe Green! I was running this place when you were in high school!” &lt;br /&gt;
Not striking enough. So you tweak it: &lt;br /&gt;
   ”I’m Moe Green! I made my bones when you were in high school!” &lt;br /&gt;
A little better. But we can do more with it. In the movie the line is: &lt;br /&gt;
   ”I’m Moe Green! I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to put this into practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask WHY. Why am I saying no? Why am I am a diet? Each time, you get closer to your values, and you can share those in conversation. Why does this work? “Why?” worries less about the words and more about their meaning, so quickly your brain thinks of other words to express the same meaning…which is step 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What other associated thoughts come to mind? Brownies, sugar. Sugar, energetic. “No, thank you, I’m already hopped up on coffee.”
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another related question: what does this mean? what are they saying? What is Moe Green implying when he says, “when you were in high school!” That he’s been the boss, making money here, while Michael was in high school diddling around.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I think like a sloth moves, and I still react to questions with the first thing I think of. Perhaps, this is why I love writing so much. With my characters, I don’t need to jump A to C in an instant. I can take my time and ask questions, with each question, getting closer to the truth of what makes them a human being. Then, days later, I can hear my character give his response in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improv: the Art of Comedy. (A to C rule.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dazzling dialogue, Scott Bell. (curving dialogue, going deeper and deeper)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some “youtube pickup artist”. (indirect communication, how women speak naturally)&lt;/li&gt;

One of the biggest takeaways that still continually revisits me is indirect communication or speaking A to C as it was called in improv. “A” is the first thing you think of.</summary></entry></feed>
