After a husband gets home late from work, his wife says dinner is cold, instead of saying I really wish you would would arrive on time because it would show me you care about the sweat I put into cooking a nice meal. Or a 10-year-old boy, after his bestfriend says toys are for babies, agrees, hiding his pain, hiding the joy that those toys bring him since they allow him to escape his parents shouting at each, escaping into a more beautiful world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do they do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once Adam and Eve eat the fruit, “the eyes of both [are] opened,” and they become self-conscious. They realize that they are naked, unprotected, and vulnerable. They realize how they can be hurt, how they will die, and how anyone like them is also vulnerable to death and suffering. With awareness of human vulnerability, the human choice of malevolence becomes possible. Mere animals also die, but they lack the self-consciousness to project their own mortality into the future. Mere animals kill, but the malevolence of Cain against Abel is a possibility only for humankind. – JBP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing the world what matters most to us, what we care about, what we identify with, is giving the world a key to our soul. We are telling them, hey, look, to hurt me, attack right here in this very spot. Tap if you want to make me wince. Twist if you want me to squirm. So to avoid that pain we hide what matters, distrusting our own desires and emotions. Distrusting our own self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much more beautiful would the world be if we could trust each other not to stomp on our souls?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is evil exists. Will likely always exist. So we will go on wearing a mask. We go on miscommunicating about how we feel, what we want, what matters. And the world – as we all co-participate in this together – becomes increasingly more confused, living in false realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do? What can we control? The hard one: we can choose the people we surround ourselves with, choose people who we trust to not stomp on our soul. And then, we can continually work to honor who we are. The harder one: we can seperate our energy from others and not let other’s opinions shake who we are. And then, we can continually work to honor who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this blog, I hope to honor who I am through posting my thoughts, my opinions, and my writings. Perhaps if I can do it here, I can return to the world with a little more courage to honor who I am.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Silence</name></author><category term="test_tag" /><summary type="html">Ficitional characters constantly hide what matters most to them, by saying or acting different on the surface from what in going on inside.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
