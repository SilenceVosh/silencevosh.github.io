By changing the tone of the story, you can take the same emotional experiences and make them lighter.

Here, like in [Gods of Egypt](https://silencevosh.github.io/2020/10/18/Gods-of-Egypt:-Jordan-Peterson.html), many of the emotions evoked are from the plot to save the world. Poppy, the main character, sets out to make sure the rock and rollers don't get all 6 strings because when they do, they will destroy all music that isn't rock. That's death to Trolls. 

Even though we are still watching a lot of anxious moments where the rock and rollers just about destroy the world, it's fun and light-hearted.
