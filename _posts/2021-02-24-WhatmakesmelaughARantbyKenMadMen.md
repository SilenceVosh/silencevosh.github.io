Here's another rant by Ken that made me smile. He's describing what it will be like working with a giant corporation, General Motors.

"Three years of monthly deadlines. Best case scenario six months of strategy statements, every one of them backed up with copy tests. And then if and when they land on something, it’s got kick its way up the ladder through all of GM until it gets to God. And then he’s gotta run it past his wife.”

I once read a book on improv comedy, and key to improv is to find the first abnormal thing in a situations then to exaggerate it. Here the abnormal thing is how slow big corporations are and how long it'll take to get any ads approved by GM because of the chain of command. With each line Ken exaggerates that a little more.
