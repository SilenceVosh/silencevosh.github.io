It's difficult for me to imagine an internal storyline for a god-like figure. So during my last reading of The Sandman, a comic that follows Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams around, I watched closely for what kind of situations he's in and how those are affecting him internally. Here's my favorite story from Gaiman.

Morpheus falls in love with a human. That isn't a story in itself. Morpheus understands that he's part of the endless and she's just a human, so it's not meant to be. He falls in love and life goes on. It becomes a story when his baby brothers — Desire and Despair — start to play a prank on him, and Morpheus becomes increasingly obsessive over this human.

It's fun to think about these all-powerful gods playing pranks and tricks on each other. Reminds me of [Loki toying with Thor](https://silencevosh.github.io/2020/11/12/Loki-toying-with-Thor.html). This simple prank makes Morpheus  human because now he's controlled by his internal desires, and now he has a story we can relate to, and now he has a character arc: can he learn to overcome this temptation and desire?

Here's another fun part of the comic. I said Desire is Dream's brother, which was wrong. Desire is his brother/sister; he/she is a hermaphrodite, as desire doesn't discriminate.
