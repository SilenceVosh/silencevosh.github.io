Knowing my character hides his true self, hides what matters to him, when I'm learning more specifics about him, I constantly ask, in every situation, where is safety for him. Where's safety in this conversation? (What is he afraid to say? To ask? Why can't he say this directly? How will his body language be different than his speech?) Where's safety in this scene? Maybe he's afraid of feeling vulnerable, and he seeks safety in filling silence with language. Or maybe, on the other side of that coin, safety is found in experiencing vulnerability with your loved one because that's when you feel a true connection with them. Maybe safety is found in not making eye contact. Maybe in staying at the office late and working, earning more money. Maybe after a BMW cuts you off, safety is found in speeding up and flicking them the bird. And on and on and on. 

Humans are fascinating creatures.
