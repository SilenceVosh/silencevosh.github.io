When sharing online, I've always stressed WHAT to say and WHAT to bring to the table. This is from the years of being flooded with crap and meaningless information that happens on the internet. Angry about all the wasted thought power, I thought you should only share something that you know is worthwhile. This prevented me from ever participating in an online conversation because the content became more important than the interaction. 

Austin's book exposed this misbelief of mine when he wrote: "Being a valuable part of a scenius is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contributeâ€”the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start."

This is empowering. I already have the skillset to interact with others. So by focusing on HOW I interact, I can see how sharing online can be easy and fun and it motivates me to get started.
