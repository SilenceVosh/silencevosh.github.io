For the last four months, perhaps longer, my coach has been telling me about every scene I submit to her, this scene "has no legs, no boots on the ground". "There's no there, there." "This is just a one off, it happens and it goes away." "**There's no consequences." "There's no** cause/effect." "There's no ceiling that the characters are bumping against." Each time, she tried to express the same thing to me. Yet no matter the words she used, it wasn't getting through to me. She even said, most directly, "You know, I don't know if I've ever told anyone this, but you need to focus more on the external, not the internal." 

And each time, I took these phrases and tried to understand what she was expressing to me. Why is the phrase There's no there, there coming to her mind? Why is she saying there are no consequences? I see consequences but clearly that's not what she's referring too. And each time, I felt like I understood, and eagerly submitted my next manuscript knowing I had it now. And each time, I failed and failed and failed.

Well, now I'm eagerly blogging about it, because I believe I finally understand.

The answer came in a picture. This last call, my coach said your character is lacking a road, a journey. These scenes that you have provided aren't affecting that road in anyway. A picture flashed in my head. My character on his deathbed, looking back on his life. What does he see? And what the hell does this picture that's presenting itself have to do with my problem?

What *do* we see when we look back? [There's a qoute which sums up the picture in my head perfectly, that I can't find for the life of me. So, instead of butchering the qoute, I drew it out, how I see it in my head.]

That's it. That's what I'm lacking. Every scene that I have provided for my coach is lacking this external life's purpose. The scenes I send have been sending are one offs, because from my character's death bed, he wouldn't even see them. That aren't externally tethered to his life's purpose.

I'm going to apologize for the series. First off, it's going to be a difficult one to get into words, as I fully don't understand it. Second, this series will become repetitive. This was a funadmental blindness, one which I was blind to in every sector of my work. So, I want to explore different attempts of the past and different ways I was thinking and approaching the problem and learn where I was blind. This has two purposes.

1. Understand what I had been blind to the whole time at the deepest level.
2. Understand how I thought before this insight and how those ways of thinking still do have benefits that shouldn't be ignored.
