For three months now, I have been working with a Story coach and it's changed the way I manage my writing. 

Every three weeks, I take a call with her and she reviews my progress of my current novel. This create a deadline that I've worked on consistently for 5 months now. And in turn necessity is curated. I am forced to create a system for processing coaching notes, for deciding what to work on, for managing what to work on (writing, research, digging up scene details), for keeping track of mistakes and learnings â€” for becoming a professional writer. If I can't figure out how to do that, I'm just wasting my money...and what better motivator is there than that.

I remember, after my first call, I had a dozen different things to work on. Completely lost what to start with. With no system, they all floating around my head, never allowing me to be immsered in the task at hand. In the end, I did the bare minimum on each. I was unstatisfied. Money wasted. 

Then, the next week, I had another dozen. I spun my wheels some more. I wasn't creating anything with substance. Money wasted.

Until one day, enough spinning in place, enough unstatisfaction, and enough little tweeks each time, I created a system filled with value. And now I can't see myself not working with a coach.

Keep spinning, you.
