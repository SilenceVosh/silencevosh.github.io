Yesterday when I included a screenshot of my actual work, the post came alive. It no longer was empty words. Because of the screenshots, the post became an artifact â€” an object made by a human being, typically an item of cultural or historical interest. And this wasn't sharing a freshly chiseled statue of David. I shared crummy notes from my day. And while I thought reading them could be interesting, not wasn't the purpose. My day and my life take on a whole new meaning when it's expressed beyond words.
