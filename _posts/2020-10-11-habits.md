Habits aren't for achieving, they are for quieting.

Which voices are causing harm? Where do you critize yourself? Where always you critizing others?

By looking at these voices you can see where you either need habits to embody a passion or a desire or you need habits to be kinder to yourself and to slow down. Life's two modes, scarficing present for the future and being present with the present -- go go go and slowing down.
