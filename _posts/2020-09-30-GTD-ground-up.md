I'm a compulsive thinker. When I work, I wonder, I follow tangents sometimes for hours. And so I had a hard time produce anything concretely. It all lingered in ideas. I was able to put this gift to use until I found a productivity system that reined me in. After so much searching, the book getting things done finally grabbed my attention enough for me to open it. Once opened, I couldn't put it down. It was the key to all my problems.

My favorite mental model from the book is how the author focuses on what's going on in your life right now. Typically when sitting down to plan your life, everyone starts with these grand goals and they work backwards. For me, all that does is add more compulsive thinking about habits and things to do. When I however look at what's on my mind right now and look at what's on my plate, what must get done â€” I gain clearly over the moment. And it's only from that space that I can build upwards.

This post came to mind after the pervious post on building characters. It's a similar thing for them. Get grounded. Find out what's going on in their life. Then justify it upwards.
