Young Dustin Hoffman. Movie from the 60s. It's difficult to get my girlfriend to watch any movie before the 2000s. But this one, perhaps she would watch because it seems like it could portray a character with some insights into who I am.

Emotion: 
- Drama focused on an insecure young man, who while insecure is sought after. Opening shot: Dustin Hoffman alone, zoomed out he's surrounded by hundreds of people.
- Dramas focus on a character acting in such a way that he effects all of those around him.
- I think we'll be waiting and waiting for him to speak up for himself and take what he wants, instead of allowing other's desires to control him. This was actually teased in the trailer, the final, when Dustin stops a wedding for the women he loves.
    - Why would they show this? I remember watching 'The Boy who Harnessed the Wind', a movie about a boy in Africa who created a power generator from a windmill and saved the village from a drought. I remember painfully watching that movie, waiting for that moment to happen, then the payoff of him finally succeeding was a huge cathartic release. I'm guessing this would have the same effect.
