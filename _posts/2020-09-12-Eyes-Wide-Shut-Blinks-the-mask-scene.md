One of the most haunting scenes I've seen is the famous mask party. 

Tom Cruise finds out about a secret sex society, from his friend who plays music blindfolded. He begs his friend for the details to the party, and after learning about it, he goes. He arrives late, but is let in because he knew the secret password. He enters this grand castle, surrounded by the world's elite. Everything is find and easy to join, as he's wandering the halls with beautiful women and people having sex all over. Everyone with a mask. 

After awhile, he's asked to go to a certain room. As he enters this is awaiting him:

He's questioned and quized and exposed. Told to get naked in front of everyone. He's completely helpless. These elites could make him disappear with the snap of their fingers.
