The first half of Jurassic Park is an idea story: what if we could bring back dinosaurs? Our desire as movie goers is to explore the ramifications of that. Here are some of the beats we get to explore:

- When Dr. Grant arrives, we see the dinosaurs resurrected and awe over it. Dr. Grant begins to match his theories to their behavior.
- Next, we learn how it was possible, how these dinosours were brought to life. Then, watching how one hatches out of an egg.
- Next, in horror, we watch a feeding, raptor devouver a cow in blink.
- We begin to discuss the morality of having something that horrifyingly dangerous here.
- Lastly, we summarized all of this with a grand tour of the park.

At the midpoint of the movie, everything changes, the storm clouds move in. Under the moon-light, the monsters are set free. Now it's a horror movie, and we are constantly running for our lives, verses something we can't comprehend.

I like this pacing, as it gives two different distinct emotions. The first is exploring and awing. The second is anxiety and dread.
