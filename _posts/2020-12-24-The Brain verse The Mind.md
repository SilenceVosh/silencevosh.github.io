A Jerry Seinfeld quote from a recent Tim Ferriss podcast —

"It’s like you’ve got to treat your brain like a dog you just got. The mind is infinite in wisdom. The brain is a stupid, little dog that is easily trained. Do not confuse the mind with the brain. The brain is so easy to master. You just have to confine it. You confine it. And it’s done through repetition and systematization."

I will borrow this distinction in nouns. The brain is primitive, while the mind is advance, high-level software.
