Here's a simple character arc.

The character is a Meh emoji. Yet inside he is bursting with life. He's told by his parents and society that he can't let that emotion show. So he suppresses them and ignores them, and that causes him to be unhappy and have problems.

It's not until he accepts he's different and expresses that difference does he save the world.

Accept all of you to break free of Mehness!
