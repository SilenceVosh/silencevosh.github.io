Here's a line of prose in my last scene:

> Throughout the entire hall the sound of silverware clashed against trays, tables, and floors. 

I wrote floors in the plural because flowed with the sentence more. I did this even knowing grammatically it should be "the floor". I wanted to note this as a reminder to myself that often how a sentence sounds is more important than grammatical errors.
