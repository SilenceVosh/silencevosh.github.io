In a book called Drawing on the back of a napkin, the author talks about how each question focuses on a different visual image. 

Where? Image of a place. Where should I travel to? Urban camping on a street in Chicago appears. In the desert at burning man appears. The milkyway appears. (Yes, please.)

When? Image in time. When did I get rejected from a girl? A image of me, 16, crying after a phone call appears. A image of me, 24, losing "the girl everyone wanted" appears. And so on. 

And so on...

How many? 

What?

Who?

First, unrelated, this made me realize the importance of choosing your question word wisely. 

Second, I found the difference of How and Why to be super interesting and relavate to these posts on life's purpose.

What images do you see when you ask a How question? How do you light a candle with a box of matches? 

You see cause and effect. The swipe of a match igniting. Maybe the feeling you get while dragging the match across the box's TK. And the match igniting the candle wick. 

Why did the candle ignite? You just cooked fish and the smells lingered. You didn't want that smell. So you lit a match, which lit a candle, and the smell went away. Our purpose was achieved through a series of cause and effects, each with its own How question. 

This is our lives too. Each moment, cause and effect. Each day, Each month, Each year, cause/effect. Each saga of our lives. All of these Hows add up to our Why. Our life's purpose.

And stories are like this. Each scene, a cause/effect, adds up to a story purpose. This is the theme of the story.
