As I'm thinking about how scenes add up to a theme or a life purpose, I am reminded of a book called Drawing on the Back of a Napkin. In that book, the author talks about how each question word, how, why, when, etc, avokes on a different visual imagein your mind. 

Where? An image of a place. Where should I travel to? Urban camping on a street in Chicago appears. In the desert at burning man appears. The milkyway appears. (Yes, please.)

When? An image in time. When did I get rejected from a girl? An image of me, 16, crying after a phone call appears. An image of me, 24, losing "the girl everyone wanted" appears. And so on. 

And so on...
- How many? 
- What?
- Who?

I found the difference of How and Why to be super interesting and relavate to these posts on life's purpose.

What images do you see when you ask a How question? How do you light a candle with a box of matches? 

You see cause and effect. A burning match inginating a candle. Maybe you see a series of cause and effect. The swipe of a match igniting. While dragging the match across the box's TK, maybe you feel the resistance in your hand. And, again, you see the match igniting the candle wick. 

Why did the candle ignite? Well, you just cooked fish and the smells were lingering. You didn't want that smell. So you lit a match, which lit a candle, and the smell went away. Our purpose was achieved through a series of cause and effects, each with its own How question. By collecting enough Hows, we arrive at the Why. 

We hear a dog bark. If that's all the information we have, we don't know why. We look at him and he's looking up into a tree. Still, we don't know why. We look up in the tree and there's a cat. Now, we understand his purpose.

Scenes in a story, or moments in our lives, are a series of Hows. Each bumps into the next. We can't understand the purpose until we have collected enough of these.
