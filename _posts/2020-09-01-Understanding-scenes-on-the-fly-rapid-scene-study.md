Recently I crossed a threshold in my understanding of how scenes work, an understanding of scene underpinnings. After hundreds of hours, I've figured this out so deeply that I can, while watching a show or a movie,  in real time see the building blocks of these scenes on the fly. This is a superpower, since every scene I consume, I gain associations for scenes in my own story. 

Here are the core questions I'm asking myself (for each character in the scene). Going deeper means the questions are tethered to either their external goal or internal yearning -- essential for a story siginificant scene.
- What do they want in this scene? (Deeper: how is what they want a stepping stone towards their overarching agenda?)
- **What is the first truly unexpected thing? What is the first thing they must choose how they will respond to?**
- How did they choose to respond? (Deeper: in what way is that choice meaningful to who they wish to be verse who they need to be? How it aligned with their overarching yearnings, both internally and externally?)
- What are the consequences of this choice? What relationships have changed or how has this character's world changed? (Deeper: how has the scene affected their overarching agenda? Have their possiblities in pursuit of their goal shrunken or grown?) [Currently, this quesiton is fuzzy in my head. I will be writing a series soon to try and make it clearer.]
- What did they learn from this? (Deeper: why does what they learned matter internally?)
- What will they do now? (Deeper: what is their new direction in pursuit of their goal?)

Okay, too many questions, not enough examples. Future Post: I'll break down one of my favorite scenes from GoT.

[not worth reading beyond this]
Just old, retired questions, that I wanted to include as a future note of my thinking.

- What was the metaphorical bridge that connected the world before the scene, to the new after the scene? Each scene serves (a) a plot purpose or (b) a character arc purpose. Great scenes serve both. What happened to progress one or both of those?
- Why is this bridge required for the story at large?
- Why does this bridge matter to the character? How it is important to him internally, as a human being in this world?
