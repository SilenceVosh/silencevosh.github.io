Recently, I was talking a scene out with my coach. The pieces were all known, but the scene wasn't quite working. The effects of the events of the scene weren't changing my character internally like we wanted.

We were struggling with the climax of the scene, the last meaningful decision. In the scene, two ten-old-years were at cross purposes about what to play. One character wanted to play baseball outside, while the other wanted to play indoors with G.I. Joes and the like. 

I knew my protagonist at the end of the scene would choose to give up his desires, and would choose to choke down what he wants to do, in order to fit in with his friend. (This was the end result we were looking for: a character begins his tragic journey of giving up the feeling of belonging for the feeling of fitting in.)

But it wasn't clicking with the rest of the pieces in the scene. My coach said, "Sometimes, it's best to just flip it." She asked, what if instead the protagonist suggest to go play baseball outside, even though he rather not. He still does make that suggestion to fit in and to please his friend. But now, his friend catches him off guard, when he jumps on that idea, and says, "Yes, I'm so happy you were thinking the same thing. These games are for babies. I'll grab my glove."

That shoves a needle into my character's heart because he loved those games, and now, he's forced to hide that joy.

That takes decades of mastering storytelling. In the meantime, perhaps this will serve as a reminder, so next time I'm stuck, I can hack my way to the answer.
