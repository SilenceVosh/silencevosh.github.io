By changing the tone of the story, you can take the same emotional experiences and make them lighter.

Here, like in Gods of Egpty [link to post], it's a save the world plot, where Poppy sets out to make sure the rock and rollers don't get all 6 strings, because when they do, they will destroy all music that isn't rock. That's death to Trolls.

Here, even though we are still watching a lot of anxious moments where the rock and rollers just about destroy the world, it's fun and light hearted.
