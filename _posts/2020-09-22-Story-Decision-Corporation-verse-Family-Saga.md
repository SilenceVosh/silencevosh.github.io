Early on in my coaching, I remember a fork in the road, two directions to drive my novel. 

Oringinally, I envisioned my story to be a family saga, where a family of three journies together into the jungle, and each of them learns something. During my 2nd call with my coach, she highlighted a line that I wrote as a throw away. I had been in the braintstormgin phase and included many tangents and ideas. This was one of them.

>The organization that hired him to translate the language, a big scary corporation who believes the language holds potential for new ways of thought, is becoming agitated with how long it's taking him. They're the ones who set up this trip for him to travel there.

This stood out to my coach. She said, that has great potential. This overlording corporation that sends him on this journey, with hidden intentions. They want the langauge to manipulate people. My character will learn that over the course of the story, and have a decision to scarfice everything he worked for.

That's not the type of story I had wanted to write. Still, I thought, this year isn't for that. It's for going through the whole novel writing process, to experience what it's like. That's my purpose. An obstacle to that purpose is attempting to write a book I'm not ready to write, like a family saga. Instead, let's focus on this overlording corporation and see where the journey takes us. 

Into the jungle!
