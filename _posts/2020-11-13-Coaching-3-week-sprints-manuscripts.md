I organize my work into three categories: 

- tasks | things I can do in one sitting.
- goals | Projects that range from roughly 3 months to 1 year.
- small-batch projects | little projects that a) make progress towards a goal, and b) once completed, provide new opportunities to pivot.

Every three weeks for my novel, focus heavily on a few small-batch projects, projects focused on specific details of my character's life, and then funnel these projects into a manuscript. My coach reads it. We talk. I get feedback. I learn. And I pivot, chasing a few new small projects, and fresh details of my character's life. The three-week repeating cycle has done wonders for my progress. 

This is the opposite of what I did all of 2019. I attacked my novel from one angle, trying to plan the whole thing out from the top, down. What happened was I never got started. It never felt right. 

Right now, I have no grand plan for where this novel is going. Because I get feedback often, I'm able to pivot often, and I tackle the novel from so many angles. I just focus on gathering character experiences one day at a time, and I'll find out where that gets me in due time. One 3 week sprint at a time.
