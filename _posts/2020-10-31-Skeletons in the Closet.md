The juice of a story is when a character's fatal flaw begins to cause skeletons in his closet.

Two ways these happen: Secrets and Lies.

Secrets and lies create false realities. Lying is the obvious form of betrayal. But even keeping secrets can create betrayal. For example, in my story, Josh, in a struggling relationship, asks his girlfriend, Em, to come on an adventure with him. He advertises the adventure by saying, "Hey, Em, look, this trip, this spark of excitement, could be what we need to save our relationship." His secret, however, is he needs Em to travel with him because where the community he's traveling into requires him to bring a female partner. So in reality, he couldn't go without Em. Now, they will travel together and spend months there, until eventually, Em finds out his intentions weren't to save the relationship but for his work. Spooked, she learns she's been living a lie.

Happy Halloween.
