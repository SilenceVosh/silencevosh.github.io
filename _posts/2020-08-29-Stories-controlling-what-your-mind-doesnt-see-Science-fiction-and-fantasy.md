Another interesting way stories convey information, without our minds turning on and questioning it, is by the setting or the genre. 

Say you want to make a point about race issues in America. So you base your movie in America with all the surrounding sides of the issue -- Black America, the KKK, the White Americas who don't speak up, the White Americas who do, all the other cultures and races, and so on. This clearly will be a movie about that issue. That is fine and great, if that's your purpose, if you want the audience throughout the film to consciously think about the issue and ask questions around it. If, on the other hand, you want that to be secondary, but you still want that issue floating around in their head, you can shift the setting into a new world, let's call it Pandora. The audience experiences the same conflicts, the same issues, but they're immerse in a story, not consciously thinking about them.

The issue is hiding in plain sight, unseen by the conscious mind.
