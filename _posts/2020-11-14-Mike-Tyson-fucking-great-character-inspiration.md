Recently I came across a clip of Mike Tyson. It scared me.

In the [video clip]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqsQrcVCB-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqsQrcVCB-0)) he talks, his voice is raspy, barely audible, and he's on the verge of tearing up, all while he's staring directly into the soul of Sugar Ray Leonard. Here's the transcript:

>I'm a student of **war**. <br><br> I know all the warriors from Charlemagne to Achilles the number one warrior of all warriors. From there, Alexander, Napoleon I know them all. I read them all. I studied them all. I know the art of fighting, I know the art of war. That's all I've ever studied. <br><br> That's why I'm so feared. That's why they feared me when I was in the ring because I was an **annihilator**. **That's what I was born for**. And now those days are gone. It's empty. I'm nothing. I'm working on being the art of humbleness, can you believe me. <br><br> That’s the reason I’m crying because I’m not that person no more.....**and I miss him.** Because sometimes I feel like a **bitch**. Because I don’t want that person to come out because if he comes out, **hell is coming with him.** <br><br> And that's **not funny**, like hey I'm a tough guy. **No**, it's just that. **I'm scared of him.**
