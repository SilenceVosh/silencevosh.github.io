It's also interesting to think how your life's purpose changes depending on when your final days are. 

When I reflect on my life's purpose from this moment, that's different from when I was 21 and all the years around and in between. What's further, all the life lived after 21 recontextizles the life before 21. As you learn and zig-zag, your purpose does as well, and new patterns emerge from your past. What I thought was a life's purpose is proven otherwise, with time. And it's not until those final days come knocking that we truly see, for the first time, what it is.

<br>
Reflecting on death does seem to be a greatly healthy and beneficial practice. It reminds you of what's important in your life in that current moment. It causes you be worry less and be more present. But I question if that's the best when to set your focuses. I question if that actually causes blindnesses, like it seemed to do with me, and [my purpose]().

<br>
This is all getting to philosical. All of this is to say, I think it's better and truer to yourself, if you focus on internal calmness, rather than external purpose. If done wisely, I think you can achive both without causing blindness and pain and not understanding.
