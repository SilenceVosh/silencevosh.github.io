It's also interesting to think how your life's purpose changes depending on when your final days are. 

When I reflect on my life's purpose from this moment, that's different from when I was 21 and all the years around and in between. It's not until those final days come knocking that we truly see, for the first time, what it is.

If I were to learn about my upcoming death,  die soon

Reflecting on death does seem to be a greatly healthy and beneficial practice. 

But living your life like you're going to die tomorrow, not so much. **This focuses on life's purpose, which I learned if you focus too much on that, you do it at the cost of your internal purpose.**

And since we don't know when they death is, it's dangerous to define your life's purpose in this moment. 

So I argue, be weary of goals. Rather focus internally, focus on finding internal peace and becoming in touch with your internal muse. Your soul.
