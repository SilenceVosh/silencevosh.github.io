A more philoacal post.

It's also interesting to think how your life's purpose changes depending on when your final days are. 

When I reflect on my life's purpose from this moment, that's different from when I was 21 and all the years around and in between. It's not until those final days come knocking that we truly see, for the first time, what it is.

Reflecting on death does seem to be a greatly healthy and beneficial practice. It reminds you of what's important in your life in that current moment. It causes you be worry less and be more present. But I think living your life like you're going to die tomorrow would be harmful.




If you take on that moto, your life purpose would become live every day like it's your last. The problem is in due time, you will feel a different life purpose. But by focusing so much on X, you turn your  internally you likely want something else. You want a family. Or to rest.  

This focuses on life's purpose, which I learned if you focus too much on that, you do it at the cost of your internal purpose.



And since we don't know when they death is, it's dangerous to define your life's purpose in this moment. 
So I argue, be weary of goals. Rather focus internally, focus on finding internal peace and becoming in touch with your internal muse. Your soul.
