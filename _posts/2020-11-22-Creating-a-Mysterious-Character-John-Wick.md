The John Wick movies follow a super-assassin, someone who is the best of the best at killing people.

Early on in the first movie, as we are getting to know who John is, he pulls into a gas station, and another car, blaring rap music, pulls up. Four Russian guys who look like trouble get out. Quickly one asks John how much for his car, which John quietly replies no, thank you and gets in his car. The Russian thug then leans in, pets John's puppy, and threatens in Russian, "Everything has a price, bitch." 

John responds, "Not this bitch.", in Russian.

It's a subtle character moment that builds a lot of mystery behind our character. We are left wondering, Who is this guy?
