This movie really tries to hit all the big emotions: action, love, humor, mystery. 

- Action: it some gore, blood, and death. A lot of pain. Yet, we never feel afraid or in pain, because the characters don't seem to be in pain. In one scene, Robert Downy Jr. lost his finger, yet he barely yelled. 
- Love: first and foremost it's a buddy cop movie with an odd couple of detectives. But also there's a romance between Robert and Harmony, a woman trying to escape with her life.
- Humor: a lot of linguistic humor from a snarky Robert Downy Jr.
- Mystery: why are all these dead women showing up and who is behind it?

Overall worth watching next time you're looking for a light adventure.
