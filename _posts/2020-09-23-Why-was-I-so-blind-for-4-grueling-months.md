Life purpose: I thought long and hard about why I was blind to all of this, blind to how the important external, concrete scenes of my character's life are the ones he sees from his deathbed. Why, instead, was I so focused on scene level consequences.

The biggest reason is because I wanted to find *external* consequences, and I misinterpreted what external means. In writing, I been taught, external means something you can see or take a photo of. So I focused on things I could see happening. Such as, Josh, after having a frightful experience at yoga, he quits attending the classes and starts working late. I could see that. And externally I stopped there, since that was the cause/effect, I thought.

But it doesn't matter what I can see, it matters what Josh sees.

The definition of what is external completely changes when you imagine it from his point of view and his deathbed. From his deathbed would Josh see that scene? Would this scene *matter*? Let's pretend his life purpose was to feed the hungry; would this scene matter? No. No it wouldn't matter. To Josh reflecting on his life â€” *this scene wouldn't be seen, it wouldn't matter. The scene wouldn't be matter.*
