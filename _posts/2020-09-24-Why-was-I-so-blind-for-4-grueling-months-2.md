I had the right question: Why? 

- Why does my character refuse to sing in the shower?
- Why does he like to mimic other's accents?
- Why did he decide to be a linguistics major?

But I imagined the answer on the wrong level, within his hierarchy of goals. 

I was so focused on, concretely, why, what is driving him to do this thing, in this moment, in this scene. (Perhaps because that' what I'm constantly focused on in my own life.) He refuses to sing in the shower because he's afraid that his girlfriend will hear his constricted voice. He likes to mimic other's accents because he believes connection (and thus safety) is found in being alike. He decided to be a linguistics major because language will give him the power of meeting people.

These becomes "one offs" because they aren't united in anyway.

What we want is his life's purpose. Here's a doodle to help me.

Since I was completely focused on the iceberg and why it existed, what it's purpose was, never did I pause to understand the flying dragon which pulled me into the iceberg. Without the dragon, the iceberg isn't a problem, doesn't affect our character who's now trending water, a purposeless character, on his couch eating potato chips. 

What's his name?

How did this iceberg effect him? Did it not even make him slow down? Did he tumble out of the air, splashing into the ocean? While in the ocean, did he transform into a sea-serpent and start dragging the character underneath the sea?

Let's say our skier's life purpose is to have a big family, dreams of at least 5 childern. 

What are some scenes which interact with that purpose?

1. He's drafted into the army just as he met who he believes to be the love of his life.
2. The love of his life cheats on him while he's away. In rage, he leaves camp to get some air, and while away the camp gets bombed. He's discharged.
3. He returns home hateful, and this attitude pushes all women away from him. 
4. Thirty years old and still wanting a big family, he begins to date younger and his family is so judgemental towards it that the man scarfices contact with them in order to continue to pursue a big family.
5. He meet a lovely girl who also loves kids and wants to get married, now, in vegas.
6. She's unable to get pregnent. His hatefulness becomes un-barriable and he takes it out on his wife who now no longer wants to even adopt with him. She leaves him.
7. The sea-serpent drags him to the bottom of the sea.

Each moment in time is being driven by this purpose.
