I'm going to complete the week here, by rolling out one last post. I've enjoyed this way of working and perhaps I experiment more with this. Every so often, without much of a plan see where my fingers take me in the course of 7 posts. Instead of my morning pages, it's my weekly pages.

Two of the most powerful questions in writing: what does my character want? what does he fear?

In Affective Neuroscience, there's a rat experiment which is testing motivations. The experimenters attached the rat's tail to a spring and depending on how hard he pulls, there's a reading of how motivated he was. The first experiment, the door opens and a piece of cheese is in front of him, he runs towards it and experiences resistance form the spring. But then, the experiments introduce a wiff of cat dander. This combination of a heaven and a hell caused the rat to be super motivated to pull the spring.

And I think this is why these two questions some up so much of a character. We get to explore both his desires, his heavens, and his fears, his hells.
