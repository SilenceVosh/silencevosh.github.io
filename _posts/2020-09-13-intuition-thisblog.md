For at least 4 years, I've wanted to start a blog. My good friend was the inspiration of blogging everyday. He treats it like a journal, where each day he sticks a pin in what he's thinking about, experiencing, or just a simple thing to he's excited for like his father meeting and falling in love with his dog. As far as I can see, there's no rules for what he posts. Whatever the muse pushes through his finger is what he writes. I wanted this.

My resistance were all these rules I had in my head about a blog, especially a daily blog. It should be centered around a theme. It should be quality over quantity. It should be well-written. These are valid, if my purpose of a blog is for business reasons. But, the way I'm seeing this is in line with my friend: it's my corner of the internet. How in the world could it be my corner, unless it expresses all of me. 

Partially, I'm writing under a pen name to free myself up. From behind this mask, I can choose my rules. And I can post parts of me, which might otherwise be suppressed by my critical voice. This frees me up to follow the muse, the muse of my intuition.
