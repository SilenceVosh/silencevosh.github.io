Now that we've collected, we have a pile of documentation, and we want to decide what is best to share. We don't care about food or pets, we care about work. We care about your process. We want to learn from you learning.

> **By sharing her day-to-day process—the thing she really cares about—she can form a unique bond with her audience.**

Austin's one simple rule: Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. "A daily dispatch" he calls it.

This is the highest aspiration we can ask of one another in their **work-life**: After a day's work, reflect on your process, reflect on your work, then ask what grabbed your attention? Where did you make a mistake? Where did you learn? What changed today? From that, capture one thing and *reflect* it back to the world. 

Some end of the end questions:

- What from my process today is a scrap worth sharing?
- What has a story to it?
- What could help someone else learn?
- What intrigued you most about your work today (trust your gut)? What interesting happened?
- What took a lot of effort to figure out?
- What inspiration from talking to others or from your own decisions?
