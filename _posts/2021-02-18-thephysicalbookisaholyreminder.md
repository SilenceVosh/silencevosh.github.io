I've always defined a holy object as something that reminds you to be a better person. These days this is my primary reason for buying physical books. Underneath my monitor I store this book.

Daily I'm reminded from this book to change how I behave. Did I document my process today? Did I share something today? Did I tell a story today? Did I interact with my scenius today? All of that is contained in this little book. What a holy object to keep close.
