Good writing flows from one paragraph to another, without causing the reader to think.

Often when I write my first drafts, I'm making big leaps section to section, then during the second draft, I go in and make sure these flow without causing the reader to think. Many times this is a simple internalization that must be explained to the reader.

Example I had written:
>“I promised the girl that I would study in the library.”<br>Ever since I was put on academic probation, my girlfriend has been nudging me to hit the books and to be in the library instead of spending lunch hour socializing with Dave. 

After I wrote this, it felt disconnected. My character was talking, then he jumped into a backstory. In order to smooth it out, there needed to be a reason to halt the conversation and give the backstory. 

Edited:
>“I promised the girl,” **I said biting my lip**, “that I would study in the library.”<br>Ever since I was put on academic probation..

This simple addition adds more questions in the reader's head. Now, craving to understand why, the backstory is welcomed. 

When I'm editing, I don't think of this, more play around until it sounds right, but next time I'm struggling this could be a hack for connecting two paragraphs together. Ask myself: How can you make the reader want to hear the next paragraph?
