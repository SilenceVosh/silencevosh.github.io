Okay, too many questions and too much theory and too much posting about how evil men could be seen in a beautiful light and about how I too would be conflicted about whether or not to save someone from ODing. Let's laugh.
<br>

In the opening of the movie Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, one character is bantering with his gay friend, and says, "But when you see a naked guy, your brain says, 'I want that.' I don't make that leap. It's like, Look, there's an elephant. Quick let's drain its blood to paint my boathouse. It's just that that's not the first thing you think of."

This is great linguistic humor.
