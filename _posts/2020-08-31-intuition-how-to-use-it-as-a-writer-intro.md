Lately, I've thought a lot about intuition out of nessesity. For a little over a year, I have been in a relationship with a beautiful women. And although I love her deep and dearly, doubts and thoughts constantly cloud my relationship to her. So, to combat these, I've been working toget more in touch with intuition, and quite frankly wondering what the hell it is.

It seems to me many people have a different idea of what it is. For my sake, my need, it's simply knowing how I should live without constantly being clouded by doubts, confusion, and the devil's advocate.

The devil's advocate... "One who argues against a cause or position, not as a committed opponent but simply for the sake of argument or to determine the validity of the cause or position." 

As an example, I was talking to my therapist about a recent situation of ours. I kept stumbling over my words and the conversation. I would start to say something and quickly stumble. My therapist says, "You have it. For a brief moment you have it, then confusion arises and blocks your thinking." This really struck me. My first thought is my intuition, then all of these counter thoughts and counter points pile on â€” causing me to not trust that first spark of genius. They're all playing devil's advocate.

In a book called the 5 personality patterns, there's one type human expression that is controlled by this confusion. It's called the rigid pattern. The rigid pattern develops often from a rule strict society or rule strict parenting. A child grows up being out of touch with how he feels and what he wants because he's constantly told don't run in the house, don't scream, boys don't cry. And what develops is a strong ego that every time the boy feels sadness, his ego, the devil's advocate, jumps into action, "Boys do NOT cry."

This is what was happening with me. Say my thought is I want to buy her roses. I want to get closer to her again. Quickly, my devil confuses me by chiming about how she hasn't done anything like that for me recently. And on and on, it goes.

So my practice of getting in touch with my intuition has started, which has sparked many ideas of how to use this in writing. (Being in touch with it is similar to the flow state, I'm thinking.) I will record these ideas as they come, both in my life and how they could be related into writing.
