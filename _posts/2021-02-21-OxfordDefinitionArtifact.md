In our daily work, we want to create artifacts. The Oxford dictionary's (second) definition: ar•ti•fact, something observed in a scientific investigation or experiment that is not naturally present but occurs as a result of the preparative or investigative procedure. So we must be like a scientist, experimenting how we work and thoroughly documenting that process. Then each day, we must share evidence of our scientific investigation. Share an artifact, and this object will take on the Oxford dictionary's first definition: an object made by a human being, typically an item of cultural or historical interest. It becomes art.
