How to find higher level goals? Simply ask why, over and over until you're satisfied. Each time you ask it, you move up the hierarchy of goals.

So, right now, a thought on my mind is to send my mom a video, a 30 second video updating her on my week. Why? Because I want to keep in touch with her. Why? Because we live far apart and it's the best way to get a glimpse of each other's lives. Why is that important? Because she feels included in my life and that means a lot to her. Why? Because she doesn't have a big family but she can have a close family. Why do I want her to feel that? Because I want her to know I'm there for her. 

My goal: mom knows I'm there for her.

My goal: send her a 30 second video.
