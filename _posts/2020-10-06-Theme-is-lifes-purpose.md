Look back at a stage of your life. You will see a whole complete story, a whole saga that you went through. You could see that you were motivated to become an engineer or a high school teacher, or to travel the US, or to find the love of your life. And you could see every setback, every change of course. You could see how this is a whole story on it's own. It could fill a novel.

Can you see a theme, a common purpose or series of learnings, which defines that whole journey? 

<br>
This, however, is one saga in a line of sagas. Your life's purpose is a collection of these stories. And we can't fully understand what that life purpose is until we are looking back at the line of stories. So although life's purpose is driving all of these, we don't see it.

Life's purpose is the story line you see looking back from your deathbed. Every day living, moment to moment, we never consciously notice this purpose. We just go about our days, learning and zig zagging. Yet, it's always there, running in the background, driving us forward, some common theme of our life.
