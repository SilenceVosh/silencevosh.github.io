I watched this trailer without any idea what it was about. A smile sat on my face the whole time.

Mockamentary, like the office, but filming what vampiers do when they aren't hunting and sucking blood. The first clip was two guys arguing about doing the dishes.

It's treating so many elements of vampiers that we see outer worldly as mundane, like one of the vampier's showing off his torture camber to the film crew.. And the other way around, watching these people with special powers struggle to get into a club. This is why I couldn't stop smiling, every clip I was watching these two opposites clash together.

As for storyline...I'm not entirely sure. I think it's an idea story, where we are watching because it's fun to think about what it would be like to be a vampier living in the real world, and we're exploring the ramifications of that, in a comedical way.

I will watch this soon.
