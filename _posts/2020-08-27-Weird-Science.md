Because of a 30th year annviersy, this 80s movie kept showing up when I browsed trailers. An eighties cult movie with over the top stupid humor.

I enjoy Tim and Eric style humor, so I gave it a shot.

The movie used fake science so overtly, we don't care. They aren't trying to pass it off as real, so our minds just accept it. 

This is just good communication by the movie. The producers understood if they walk that line between real and not, the audience will question. But if they show, they themselves don't care about the science, then a healthy mind naturally understand what they are communicating, and completely neglects it. 

This is a fundamental skill of a writer: controlling what the audience doesn't see, controlling what their brain naturally neglects.
