A few questions to refer to next time I'm thinking too robotic:
- Where is the pain?!
- Why is this painful? What do they desire? What do they believe would make them happy?
- What event isn't neutral (that you likely bypass as if they were neutral)?

- What voices of the past were triggered?
- What irrational thoughts are they having?
- What does he fear that isn't rational?
- What deeper meaning are they reading into these events, (a meaning that likely is misguided)?

- What emotions are they experiencing?
- What emotions will they carry forward?

- What ill-decisions will they make from this pain or this emotion that they are carrying along?
- What's going on in his life to make this pain cost something?
