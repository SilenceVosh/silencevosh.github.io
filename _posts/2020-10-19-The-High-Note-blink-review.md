I surprisingly enjoyed the movie 'The High Note', just as I surprisingly enjoyed 'A Star is Born'. I must be a sucker for watching talented musicians, especially singers. I get to experience some major wish-fulfillment.

Watching a great musician, especially a humbly talented one like both of those movies have, fulfills some deep yearning of mine. A voice with power. A voice not hiding anything. And someone who stands comfortably in the spotlight. All while being there for the music and not the fame.

The only spotlight I have experienced in my life is the invisible one that I follows me around public, the one that I cower away from day after day. There's probably a correlation here. Just once before it's my time, I should grab the karaoke mic and voluntarily, stepping out of my invisible one, into the real one, to learn neither of them matter.
