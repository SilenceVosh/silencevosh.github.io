Show: The Good Place

Michael, the literal architect of the heavens, helped out a human architect on earth, by gifting him a blueprint of a new building, a dream blueprint. The human's dream building.
He tells Michael, "This is is the most amazing print I've ever seen. But where are the bathrooms?"
Michael goes on to explain how it was silly of him to forget that, and saying how in the world could I forget that, because "I too love and need bathrooms, and the thing you sit on, and shoot into."

I want to stick a pin in these from time to time, to understand humor better.
Here, there were two laughs for me. The first, caused by a status change: we are picturing this godly blueprint, yet, we learn, it's missing one of the most fundamental pieces to a bathroom. The second: Michael unintentionally using linguist humor, by describing something in an unexpected yet realistic way.
