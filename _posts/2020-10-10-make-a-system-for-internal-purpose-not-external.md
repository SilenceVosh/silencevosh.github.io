To be honest, I don't know how to focus internally; it's soemthing I'm learning. My whole life, I've focused externally, and I've become extremely good at acheiving that. I've learned how to show up every day, and how to parse the complex world into what data will most benefit my external goal. I've learned to do this -- happily -- at the cost of my internal desires. Scarficing the present for the future, I thought. 

Ironically, I think the book Getting Things Done is my answer to this problem. The system is farily simple. You capture all your thoughts into a notebook, then you decide which of those do you next to act on, which of those require some action in order for it to not be on your mind. Simple example, "I should call Dan." I can't find internal peace until I either call Dan or until I have the call in a system that will remind me to call Dan at a late date.

That's the mental model. Take anyhting that's bothering you or that youre struggling with and put it in a system. It's almost like an assistant to remind you, hey, be kind to yourself. I've called this western buddism because it's pulls on both worlds: we can try and find internal peace and presence, while still living in America with captialize and material things. 

Still, it's easy to us this to focus on the external, focusing back on achieving and changing who we are.

A mistake I make in my thinking: I'm not yet an author but I'll become one. Then I work my ass off for that. Focusing on externally, what do I need to do to get there. But internally, I'm already an author. Clearly there is something in my that has a drive for this and a passion for this. This way of thinking is what causes the internal pain and harm. It's what causes blindnesses, because the time might come where I no longer feel that passion, yet externally, I've commited too much to quit.

So the trick is to have a system which algins with your internal selves.
