At the end of the day, if we can't control our life's purpose and perhaps by doing so, we cause internal harm, what can't we control?

I argue make a system for yourself to stay true to yourself. This isn't to say seeking an ideal self is bad. I think your true self also seeks an ideal self. 

How is this related to writing?

Not to control internal purpose but to statify it and calm it.
