Thor, the thunder god, and Hymir, a giant, go on a fishing trip. Thor wanting to catch the biggest fish he could find steers the boat into the deepest and darkest part of the sea. What he ends up facing is Jormundand, a legendary sea serpent.

The way Neil Gaiman's described this earned a blog post of its own: 
> Thor held onto the line.<br>"It's going to drag us under."<br>Boomed Hymir in horror. "Let go of the line."<br>Thor shook his head.<br>He strained against the fishing line determined to hold on. The thunder god slammed his feet through the bottom of the boat and used the sea bottom to brace himself, and he began to hall Jormungand onto the boat.

The thunder god slammed his feet through the boat and using the sea bottom to brace himself, love that. It's so visual and fun because why can't the thunder god do that.
