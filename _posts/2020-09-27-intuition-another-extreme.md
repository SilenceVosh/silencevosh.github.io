While watching Silver Linings Playbook, a story which follows a romance of two medically dognostic crazy epople, I understand, this is also an exterem. 

Pat (Bradley Copper) doesn't have social rules in his head. He's frantic, fast thinker, and unfiltered. There's no societal voice telling him don't ask someone you just met about their dead  ex-boyfriend nor telling him don't wake our parents up at 3am and rant about TK_book. He feels pulled to do it.

There's something deeply profound about this. There's passion, there's curiosity, there's aliveness unlike we experience with the ego taming us. And at the same time, no one wants him around, he's a complete wild-card. We like our order. And in order to keep it, we will give up profundity.
