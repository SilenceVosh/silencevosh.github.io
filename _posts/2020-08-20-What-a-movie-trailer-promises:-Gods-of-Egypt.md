Promises:

- A thriller. There are many types of thrillers. Sometimes a man is trying to escape prison without being caught (Escape from Pretoria). Sometimes a man is in a physical life or death chase for his life, (The Game). Sometimes, the world is about to end or a city is about to blow up, and the hero needs to stop that, (The Dark Knight). Gods of Egypt falls into that last category.
- Typical emotion experienced: anxiety, stressed that the hero won't save the world, or find the serial killer before he kills again, or escape with his life.
- We get to watch someone succeed often while things still get worse. (Jame Bond movies)

Other emotions:

- wonder over watching the God fight.
- humor, likely a lot of status changes, humans acting like gods, gods acting like humans.
