After I wrote the post [Externalize, Ripple, Justify](https://silencevosh.github.io/2020/08/24/Externalize-Ripple-specificallyJustify.html), I realized how far I've come as a writer. Being able to do what I described there, by free forming events of a story that are centered around a united story significant idea, is a grand achievement. One that almost slipped by without me appreciating the view.

From here , the view is crystal blue, floating ice everywhere. The land beneath me glides through calm seas, which beckoned me to decend deeper.
