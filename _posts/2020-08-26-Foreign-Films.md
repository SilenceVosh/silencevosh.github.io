Talking with an Argentine movie lover, he told me, he refuses to watch a movie that's dub into Spanish. "It's loses all its flavor," he said.

I grew up on Disney and Hollywood films and I wasn't introduced to foreign films until 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' became famous, and even then as an egotistical high schooler I wondered why in the world would someone watch a movie that wasn't in English. 

I, as someone who is controlled by words and thoughts, love picturing how the knowledge isn't in the words. To understand the story, you don't even need the words. You just need to experience the tones, the expressions, the emotions of the film.

This will be a good experiment to try and calm my overactive mind. Put on a Chinese film, without subtitles, and feel your way through the movie.
