Talking with an Argentine movie lover, he told me, he refuses to watch a movie that's dubbed into Spanish. "It's loses all its flavor," he said.

Growing up on Disney and Hollywood films, I wasn't introduced to foreign films until 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' became famous, and even then as an egotistical high schooler I wondered why in the world would someone watch a movie that wasn't in English. 

I, as someone who is constantly controlled by words and thoughts, love picturing how the knowledge isn't actually in those words. To understand the depth of what's going on, you don't even need the words. You just need to experience the tones, the expressions, the emotions of the film.

To taste a new flavor of life, I will try an experiment: Put on a Chinese film, without subtitles, and feel my way through the movie.
