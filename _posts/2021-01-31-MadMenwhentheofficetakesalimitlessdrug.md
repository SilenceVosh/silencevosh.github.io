I've finished all 7 Seasons of Mad Men. One of the most memorable scenes was in Season 6, Episode 8. In that episode, the entire office was ejected with some steroid, like limitless, and they all acted like they're drugged out of their minds with coffee. My favorite interaction was between Don and Ken. 

Big-eyed and speaking very fast, Ken asks: “Do you think you’ll have new work on Monday."
“I’ll have 15 campaigns for you by then,” Don says intensely. “But you have to get me into a room so I can look them in the eye. *The timbre of my voice is as important as the content.* I don’t know whether I’ll be forceful or submissive but I must be there in the flesh.”
“You understand that I have no power whatsoever?” Ken starts to bob his knees up and down. 
“That’s not true unless they like you.”
“Oh they like me all right.” Ken smiles and begins to dance, tapping his cane against the floor. “I’m their favorite toy."
“That’s your job.”
“It’s my job to take them to dinner at 80 miles an hour. It’s my job to stop a mile from the restaurant so they can have five pounds of carbs legs and three bottles of beer apiece and then go get prime rib.” The dance is now a full-on tap dance. “It’s my job to go hunting so they can fire off their guns an inch from my ear and laugh when I get startled because it’s my job.” Ken dramatically finished the dance flaring his arms out wide.
Don pauses. Shocked over Ken's dance. “Where’d you learn that?
“My mother. No my first girlfriend.” Ken taps his cane once more, twirls it in the air, and catches it. He spins and dances away.

It's an over the top scene, but it's so enjoyable. Here it is, only 1 minute long: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nDsLx98SI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6nDsLx98SI)
