At the start of the year, when I was goal set, I had a big realization. At the time, I had been thinking about the differences between my character's external and internal goals. I kept noticing stories aren't about the external goal as much as the internal. In many stories, the character doesn't achieve their external goal but they find peace internally. Or in many others, the character achieves their external goal but they realize that don't even care about it, for internally they're now at peace.

And I got questioning: is there a way to choose goals more wisely to avoid this? Could we instead focus internally? I started asking, what will this external goal give me internally? What desires will it fulfill, what internal hells will it destroy?

My goal: mom knows I'm there for her. Internally, I think it important to care for my mom, important to cherish her as the women who made it all possible. Internally, I want to feel like I'm being a good son. 

Now, the next question was the game changer for me. 

How else could I achieve that internally? Ideas swarm from the depths.

- I could send her little texts throughout the week.
- I could make sure to send her a thoughtful gift.
- I could share recipes that I'm experimenting with.

How else could I achieve that internally? Get outside the box!

- I could bring warm food to homeless women.
- I could send little messages to my girlfriend's mother.
- I could recycle more. I could save water more. I could not use so many plastic bags.
- I could personality congratulate my friends wives on mother's day.

Internally, all of these connect with that energy, even though I can't explain why.
