[Normally I write posts one at a time, jumping one to the next, but these last 4 posts have been a continual series. Perhaps too much espresso ripping through my viens.]

In [Externalize, Ripple, & specifically Justify to a root cause] (link here) I ended by saying:

> This isn't to say all that conceptual work I did before was a waste. ... at this point, stating something story significant isn't something I need to think about, because of the countless hours thinking about the story problem and figuring out the concepts and pondering the central issue.

This applies to my characters and allows me to ask, what's going on with them right now. I'm not going to go off saying, well Russia just launch a nuclear warhead at the US. So, he's thinking about how to spend his last days on earth. Instead, because of all that work, I stay within the story.

And this got me thinking how it's the same with getting things done. We don't need to wonder, how should I spend my life, what goals should I set. Instead our own thoughts, emotions, and life in general will point out what to work on. That doesn't mean ignore any ambitions. On the contrary. Ambitions are beckoning you somewhere. What can you do in this moment for that ambition? Once you start to get a handle on everything going on in your life right now, then you can start cutting things out and you can start exploring the purpose of these ambitions, for a higher level goal.
