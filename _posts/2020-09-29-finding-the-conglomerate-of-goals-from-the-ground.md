One hack of creating a character with a conglomerate of goals is to make a list of questions. Then conscious practice these over and over until they're in your bones. But I've been playing around with an easier way, a simple question: what's going on with them?

Let's say my character Joe just got put on academic probation, and I know we'll decide to buck up and focus on grades. So to find details of this situation, to find the scene, we could ask a bunch of questions about his goals and his fears. Or simply ask...

What's up in their life right now? Well, he got put on probation, so likely didn't focus on grades. 

What's he thinking about? He has his father's voice replying in his head. Youre the first in our family to attend college. Make the most of it. What deeper meaning is he reading into these thoughts? I can't even tell him that I'm on probation. He would be knocking at my door in 2 hours. I wouldn't have any time to spend with Susie, my current college girlfriend. Susie would think I'm immature with my father visiting me with PB&J. 

What emotions does he carry around because of this all? He feels a sense of weakness, a sense of inferiority. Grades used to be the one thing that he had over his college best friend Dave. Now, he's second fiddle in everything. In these days, he'll be looking to prove himself. Perhaps this emotion motivates him to go talk to a group of girls and something happens that mortifies him. He retreat from a social life into books, spending most his college from that day forward in the library.

Just by looking at what's happening in his life at that moment, what he's thinking about and feeling, the complex layers expand. Now that our feet are on the ground, we can begin to see how this plays in with his more abstract goals.
